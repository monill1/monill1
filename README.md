Hello! This is my GitHub repository where I showcase my data science and analytics projects. I have completed my post-graduation in Data Science, and I am passionate about working with data to gain insights and solve real-world problems.

In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I have worked on during my academic and professional journey. The projects showcase my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization.
